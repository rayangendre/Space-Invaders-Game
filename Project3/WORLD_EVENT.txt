World Event
- when the mouse is clicked there is a rocket that is created and sent across the screen to that point
- the rocket leaves from the left side of the screen and goes straight, obstacle ignoring
-if the point has a asteroid, the asteroid will be removed and an explosion will happen
-if the point is empty space, an explosion will only happen there
-if an alien is at that point, the alien will be killed and explosion happens
-if the point is either a gold goal or a mothership, the rocket will disappear and not explode
-a rocket cannot be spawned where the player ship is, doesnt make sense to call a strike on your own ship
